## Project Description

This app will serve as a character sheet creator for a Dungeons & Dragons 5E player. They will be able to also update their character sheet as they play and level up. The backend will manage the CRUD operations and database for the frontend.

## User Stories

As a user I want to use an app to create a D&D character sheet, so that I can easily have access to updating and managing multiple character sheets at once.
